% The Photometric LSST Astronomical Time Series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC) is an open 

% data challenge to classify simulated astronomical time-series data in preparation for observations 

% from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), which will achieve first light in 2019 and 

% commence its 10-year main survey in 2022. LSST will revolutionize our understanding of the 

% changing sky, discovering and measuring millions of time-varying objects. 



% PLAsTiCCis a large data challenge for which participants are asked toclassify astronom-ical 

% time series data. These simulated time series, or ‘light curves’ are measurements ofan object’s 

% brightness as a function of time - by measuring the photon flux in six differ-ent astronomical 

% filters (commonly referred to as passbands).  These passbands includeultra-violet, optical 

% and infrared regions of the light spectrum.  There are many differenttypes of astronomical 

% objects (that are driven by different physical processes) that we sep-arate into astronomical classes.


% This arff represnts a snap shot of the data avilable and is created from the train set published in the aforemention compition.

% 36 dimension was chosen as it represents a value at which most instances would not be truncated.
